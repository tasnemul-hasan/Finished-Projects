Title:

UAV-Based Vehicle Detection and Tracking : High-Speed Vehicle Chase


Abstract:

The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for vehicle detection and tracking has gained increasing significance in applications such as surveillance, military operations, and smart city traffic management. Aerial imagery introduces unique challenges, including noise, shadows, occlusions, rapid object movement, and small target sizes, making high-speed vehicle detection particularly demanding. While existing computer vision models have improved real-time processing and detection accuracy, they primarily focus on stationary or slow-moving vehicles, leaving a gap in addressing high-speed vehicle tracking scenarios. This study benchmarks various detection and tracking algorithms for high-speed vehicle chases, presenting a robust framework for UAV-based vehicle re-identification and tracking. By addressing critical issues such as dynamic camera motion, varying altitudes, and complex backgrounds, the proposed workflow integrates object detection, feature extraction, bounding box filtering, and tracking for consistent performance across diverse scenarios. The evaluation, conducted using manually annotated aerial footage, highlights both strengths and limitations, including1challenges with extreme zoom variations and feature similarity confusion. Statistical benchmarking of detection and tracking models further underscores the systemâ€™s effectiveness while identifying areas for improvement, such as automated annotations and advanced tracking algorithms. This work demonstrates the potential of UAV-based systems for high-speed vehicle tracking, offering valuable insights for applications in surveillance, defense, and traffic management
