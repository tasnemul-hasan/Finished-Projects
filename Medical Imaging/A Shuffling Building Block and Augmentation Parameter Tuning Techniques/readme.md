Abstract:
The recent COVID-19 outbreak showed us the importance of faster disease diagnosis using medical image processing as it is considered the most reliable and accurate diagnostic tool. In a CNN architecture, performance improves with the increasing number of trainable parameters at the cost of processing time. We have proposed an innovative approach of combining efficient novel architectures like Inception, ResNet, and ResNet-Xt and created a new CNN architecture that benefits Extreme Cardinal dimensions. We have also created four variations of the same base architecture by varying the position of each building block and used X-Ray, Microscopic, MRI, and pathMNIST datasets to train our architecture. For learning curve optimization, we have applied learning rate changing techniques, tuned image augmentation parameters, and chose the best random states value. For a specific dataset, we reduced the validation loss from 0.22 to 0.18 by interchanging the architecture's building block position. Our results indicate that image augmentation parameters can help to decrease the validation loss. We have also shown rearrangement of the building blocks reduces the number of parameters, in our case, from 5,689,008 to 3,876,528.
